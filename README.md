Bio-feeding And Monitoring Analysis in Sports using MediaPipe Pose Estimation with AI

  # Introduction:
In the realm of sports, precision and technique are paramount. The introduction of bio-feeding and monitoring analysis, powered by cutting-edge technology, is revolutionizing the way athletes train and perform. This innovative approach involves real-time tracking and analysis of an athlete's posture, joint angles, and movement patterns using MediaPipe and computer vision techniques, supplemented by the accuracy of goniometry. By providing instantaneous feedback, this system empowers athletes to make immediate corrections during their training sessions, ensuring they maintain the desired form and technique.

  # Motivation:
The motivation driving this project on Bio-feeding and monitoring analysis in sports is rooted in the relentless pursuit of excellence and athletic achievement and because it offers several advantages over the conventional and traditional methods of training and monitoring athletes. Athletes continually strive to optimize their performance, and every minute detail can make a significant difference. The importance of this motivation is threefold:

# Precision and Technique: 
In sports, mastering the right form and technique can be the difference between success and failure. Bio-feeding and monitoring offer athletes a chance to attain near-perfect execution by providing real-time insights into their posture, joint angles, and movement patterns. This level of precision is often unattainable through traditional observation or manual measurements, reducing the margin for errsor in training and conventional methods often rely on post-training analysis or occasional coaching feedback, which can lead to delayed corrections. This also enables athletes to choose target angle limits for personalized training
This also help in rehabilitation and recovery of athletes in identifying faulty movement patterns that may have contributed to the injury and guild the development of a rehabilitation program in tracking the joint angles, assess range of motion and monitoring the improvement.  This also enables athletes to choose target angle limits for recovery.

#Performance Enhancement:
When athletes understand how their body moves during specific actions e.g. running, jumping and throwing. They can easily identified areas where they can improve their efficiency and effectiveness. So the next phase of my project is to build performance enhancement system analysis for these basic three actions and possible other actions that will allow athletes to make adjustment in their form, posture, and timing to maximize their performance. The optimization can lead to overall athletic ability.

# Injury Prevention: 
Ensuring that athletes perform exercises with correct form is essential for injury prevention. Many sports-related injuries can be attributed to improper technique. By addressing these two basic issues above promptly, this system helps reduce the risk of injuries, thus extending an athlete's career and enhancing their overall well-being.

  # Objective:

The main objectives of this project are aligned with the enhancement of athletes' performance and well-being through Bio-feeding and monitoring:

# Real-time Feedback: 
Develop a Biofeeding and monitoring artificial intelligence system that offers real-time feedback on athletes' posture, joint angles, and movement patterns during training sessions.

# Instant Corrections:
Enable athletes to make instant corrections based on the feedback provided by the system, ensuring they maintain the desired form and technique.

# Performance Improvement:
Facilitate significant improvements in athletes' performance by continuously optimizing their biomechanics through precise monitoring and corrective guidance.

# Injury Mitigation: 
Contribute to the reduction of sports-related injuries by promoting proper technique and posture, thus enhancing athletes' long-term health and career prospects. 

# Rehabilitation and Recovery:  
This help athletes in identifying faulty movement patterns that may have contributed to the injury and guild the development of a rehabilitation program in tracking the joint angles and monitoring the improvement. 
By achieving these objectives, this project aims to unlock the full potential of athletes, enabling them to reach new heights in their respective sports while minimizing the risk of setbacks due to injuries or suboptimal technique.

  # Data Collection:
In this project, data collection plays a crucial role in capturing athletes' body movements during exercises. The process involves the use of cameras and MediaPipe's pose estimation framework to track the athletes' poses in real-time. Here's a detailed breakdown of the data collection process I use:

# Camera Setup:
A camera is positioned to capture the athletes' movements. This camera can be a standard webcam or any video recording device.
MediaPipe Pose Estimation: The project utilizes MediaPipe, an AI-based framework, for pose estimation. A class named poseDetector is defined in the code, which configures the MediaPipe pose estimation model for tracking body landmarks.

# Real-time Pose Tracking: 
As the athletes perform exercises, the camera continuously records their movements. The findPose method of the poseDetector class processes each frame, detecting and tracking the landmarks of the athlete's body.

# Landmark Visualization: 
Detected landmarks, including key joint positions, are visualized on the video frame using the mpDraw.draw_landmarks function. These landmarks represent key points on the athlete's body, such as shoulders, elbows, and wrists

# Landmark Data Collection:
The findPosition method of the poseDetector class retrieves the coordinates (x, y) of these landmarks, allowing for the collection of data about joint positions at each frame.

# Use of goniometry to measure joint angles:
To measure joint angles accurately, goniometry is employed in the project. Goniometry is a technique used to quantify joint angles and assess range of motion. In this context, it is used to determine the angles formed at various joints of the athlete's body during exercise. The joint angles of interest include those at the elbow, shoulder, knee, hip or any other relevant joint depending on the exercise being analyzed.

   # Data Analysis:
The collected data, which consists of joint positions and angles over time, undergoes a comprehensive analysis. Here's how the data analysis is carried out:
Angle Calculation: The findAngle method of the poseDetector class calculates the angles between key joint positions. It uses the collected landmark data to compute joint angles such as those at the elbow or knee.

# Interpolation: 
The calculated angles are then interpolated to map them to a percentage scale between the minimum and maximum ideal angles specified by the user. This interpolation allows for a standardized representation of joint angles, making it easier to provide feedback.

# Feedback Generation:
An AI-based system continuously monitors the athletes' joint angles in real-time. Based on the interpolated angles, the system provides real-time feedback to the athletes. This feedback can be visual or auditory and is designed to guide the athletes in maintaining optimal joint angles during exercises and monitoring the range of motion.

# Error Detection: 
The system detects errors or deviations from the desired joint angles and provides corrective feedback. For example, if an athlete's elbow angle falls below the minimum threshold during a bicep curl, the system prompts them to ‘lift their hand higher.’

# Use of standardized measurements for angles:
Standardized measurements are essential for consistent and meaningful analysis. In this project, the joint angles are standardized using interpolation techniques. The angles are mapped to a percentage scale ranging from 0% (representing the minimum ideal angle) to 100% (representing the maximum ideal angle). This standardization allows for a uniform representation of angles, making it easier to provide feedback and compare performance across different athletes and exercises and monitoring the range of motion.

I accurately combined data collection through MediaPipe's pose estimation, goniometric angle measurements, and AI-driven feedback generation, which helps my project, in enhancing athletes' performance and reduce the risk of injury during exercises.

Based on the standardized joint angle data, the system generates real-time feedback to guide the athletes in maintaining optimal joint angles during exercises. Feedback can be visual or auditory and serves to correct deviations from ideal joint angles.

# 7.	Error Detection and Correction:
The AI system identifies errors or deviations from desired joint angles. For instance, if an athlete's elbow angle falls below the minimum threshold during a bicep curl, the system prompts them to "lift their hand higher." This feedback mechanism assists athletes in adjusting their technique for better results and injury prevention.
